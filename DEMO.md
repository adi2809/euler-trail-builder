# ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Euler Trail Builder - Demo Guide

## ðŸš€ New Features Overview

This enhanced version now supports:
- **Multiple edges** between the same two nodes
- **Mixed directed and undirected edges** in the same graph
- **Self-loops** (edges from a node to itself)
- **Enhanced visualization** with curved edges
- **Detailed statistics** showing edge type breakdown

## ðŸŽ® How to Test the New Features

### 1. Multiple Edges Between Same Nodes
1. Select "Create Edges" mode
2. Choose "Undirected" edge type
3. Click node A, then node B to create first edge
4. Click node A, then node B again to create second edge
5. Notice the curved visualization for multiple edges

### 2. Mixed Directed/Undirected Edges
1. Create some undirected edges (black lines)
2. Switch to "Directed" edge type
3. Create some directed edges (red lines with arrows)
4. Check the statistics panel for counts:
   - **Total Edges**: Combined count
   - **Directed**: Red arrows (â†’)
   - **Undirected**: Black lines (â†”)
   - **Multiple Edges**: Pairs with >1 edge

### 3. Self-Loops
1. Select "Create Edges" mode
2. Click the same node twice to create a self-loop
3. See the curved self-loop visualization

### 4. Enhanced Euler Trail Finding
1. Create a mixed graph with both edge types
2. Click "Find Euler Trail"
3. The algorithm now handles:
   - Mixed connectivity analysis
   - Degree calculations for mixed graphs
   - Enhanced path finding

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

### Edge Colors & Styles
- **Undirected edges**: Black solid lines
- **Directed edges**: Red lines with arrow markers
- **Multiple edges**: Curved paths to avoid overlap
- **Self-loops**: Curved loops from node to itself

### Statistics Panel
- **Real-time updates** as you build the graph
- **Detailed breakdown** by edge type
- **Multiple edge detection** and counting
- **Connection status** for mixed graphs

## ðŸ§® Algorithm Enhancements

### Backend Improvements
- `_mixed_connectivity_ok()`: Validates mixed graph connectivity
- `_analyze_mixed_graph()`: Comprehensive graph analysis
- `_hierholzer_mixed()`: Enhanced Eulerian path algorithm
